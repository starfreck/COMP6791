Information for... Future students Student hub Alumni friends Parents Faculty staff Media Site search Concordia Directories Search Student Hub Concordia.ca Students Course registration Course withdrawals Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Course withdrawals Term Dates and Deadlines Students who wish to withdraw from a course or courses must do so online. You can also find this link in My CU Account. When you drop a course online you must make sure to confirm your transaction and or verify your registration record to ensure that the course was in fact properly dropped. It is the student s responsibility to meet all deadlines and follow all necessary steps to withdraw from a course s or from the University. Not attending classes or informing an instructor of an intent to withdraw does not constitute official withdrawal. It is not mandatory for an instructor to provide the student with any evaluation or feedback of their progress in a course before the withdrawal deadline. Students who do not properly withdraw before the published deadlines will receive failing grades. Course withdrawal There are two different types of course withdrawal DNE Did Not Enter The DNE withdrawal has no academic or financial impact on the student and does not appear on the student s academic record. DISC Discontinued The course as well as a DISC withdrawal notation remains on a student s academic record but does not affect the student s GPA. However the student is financially responsible for the payment of all tuition and other fees pertaining to the course. These course withdrawal deadline dates can be found at Term Dates and Deadlines. Late Course Withdrawals How to submit a request for late withdrawal DNE or refund of fees on a discontinued DISC undergraduate course Carefully read the instructions and information on all applicable forms. Complete and sign the appropriate Student Request Form as follows Faculty of Arts and Science Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science Faculty of Fine Arts and John Molson School of Business students Student Request for Late Registration Withdrawal Independent Students Independent Student Request Form Attach the following supporting documents to your request A clear and detailed written explanation of the unforeseen event s or circumstance s which prevented you from dropping the course s by the deadline. Indicate if you are asking for a refund financial credit of fees for this course s . A written statement from the instructor of the course s confirming when you stopped attending class and that you did not complete course work or exams after that date. All relevant documentation which supports your case. This might include but is not limited to such documents as Student Request Medical Certificate English Fran ais duly completed signed and stamped by a licensed medical practitioner the MD s licence number must be clearly noted on the form hospital record s death certificate accident police report travel tickets Submit your request as follows Students registered in a Faculty of Arts and Science program must submit to the academic department housing the program in which they are registered. Students registered in a Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science program must submit to the School s Student Academic Services Office. Students registered in a Faculty of Fine Arts program must submit to the Faculty Undergraduate Student Academic Services Office. Students registered in a John Molson School of Business program must submit to the Faculty Undergraduate Programs Office. Independent students must submit to the Birks Student Service Centre. General Rules The Student s Responsibility Once you register in a course s at the University you become responsible for following the University s published rules regulations and guidelines and ensuring that you understand the academic requirements of your program s of study. You are responsible for providing all the necessary information and supporting documentation when submitting a request. Incomplete requests will not be considered. Why are refunds normally not applicable after the DNE deadline There are three main reasons why the University has a deadline for tuition refunds When you withdraw after the DNE deadline you have prevented another student from taking your seat in the classroom. If you had dropped the course before the deadline another student could have registered for the course. The University s costs are not reduced when you withdraw from a course e.g. instructor s salary technology infrastructure classroom space etc. You are not the only one paying for your education. In fact most students tuition fees cover only about 25 of the total cost of their education. The other 75 of your education is funded by the Minist re de l ducation et de l Enseignement sup rieur. When you withdraw after the DNE deadline and are granted a Late Withdrawal retroactive DNE the University not only forfeits the money it returns to you but also the government funding attached to your registration. Remember the DNE and DISC deadlines are published at Term Dates and Deadlines. Check the deadlines every term it is your responsibility to know what the deadlines are. Exceptional circumstances In certain very limited circumstances a student may be granted a late withdrawal DNE or a full partial refund on a discontinued DISC course after the DNE deadline. Late withdrawals and refunds are only given when you could not have withdrawn before the DNE deadline because of serious extenuating circumstances. These circumstances must be unforeseeable and beyond your control. Please note that if your request is approved the University Retroactive Withdrawal Committee will decide whether you qualify for a retroactive DNE or a full partial refund with a DISC notation. In some cases when DNE s are granted an administrative fee of 35 per credit may be applied. Examples of requests that are NOT granted You did not know the deadline and or procedures for withdrawing from courses. Remember you are responsible for making yourself aware of University deadlines. Your financial situation has changed and you cannot afford to attend University any more. You lost your job you accepted a new job offer you have a work schedule conflict or your work hours have increased. You have a problem with child care arrangements. You did not attend the course s you registered for. You attended another university or college and did not withdraw from your Concordia course s . You did not pay your Concordia fees by the deadline date and assumed that your current registrations would automatically be cancelled. Your government financial aid was delayed or the value of your government financial aid was less than you expected to receive. In the case of personal bankruptcy please contact the Student Accounts Office at 514 848 2424 ext. 4900. Examples of requests that may be granted Particular medical circumstances A serious illness or severe injury prevented you from withdrawing from your course s by the DNE deadline. You became seriously ill or were severely injured after the DNE deadline and as a result were unable to complete your course s . Requests based on medical circumstances must be accompanied by a duly completed Student Request Medical Certificate English Fran ais . If this Medical Certificate is not included with your request your request will automatically be denied. Please note that medical certificates may be verified before a request is considered and or granted. To save time please ensure that the medical certificate completed by your doctor includes all the information requested along with their medical license number and a telephone number where they can be reached during regular business hours. The medical certificate may be refused if it is insufficiently explicit or appears to lack seriousness or on its face raises doubt as to its authenticity. Unfortunately the fact that illness is usually not predictable and is nobody s fault does not automatically qualify you for a late withdrawal DNE or a refund of fees on a discontinued DISC course s . You may be able to work out an alternative way to complete a course with your professor. You may be eligible for a MED DEF or INC course notation. See 16 of the Undergraduate Calendar for an explanation of these notations. If you must withdraw after the DNE deadline and before the DISC deadline you have to drop the course on your student portal My CU Account . Particular non medical circumstances Certain requests for late withdrawal DNE or a refund of fees on a discontinued DISC course s may be accepted in particular non medical circumstances. For example There has been a recent death in your immediate family or other circumstances which have caused you severe emotional stress. You have unexpectedly assumed long term primary responsibility for taking care of an immediate member of your family who is seriously ill. Requests based on non medical circumstances must be accompanied by complete supporting documents that are appropriate to the situation including but not limited to a death certificate medical certificate airline ticket etc. Things to Remember Reason for submitting a request Your reason for the request must be related to circumstances that were unforeseeable and beyond your control. Submission deadlines A student request shall be made within a reasonable period of time from the circumstances giving rise to the request. Normally the following guidelines apply A request with respect to a Must be submitted by Summer session course session ending in 1 November 1 Fall term course term ending in 2 March 1 Fall Winter course term ending in 3 August 1 Winter term course term ending in 4 August 1 In determining whether the period of time elapsed is reasonable all of the circumstances of the case shall be evaluated. Requests from previous academic terms will not be accepted without a detailed explanation for the delay in submitting a request. For further information please see the Undergraduate Calendar Section 16.1.7 Student Request Committees and Refund of fees financial credit on account or refund Withdrawal from the university Students who wish to withdraw from the University completely must Withdraw from their courses by the appropriate deadline ONLINE.

Future students Student hub Alumni friends Parents Faculty staff Media Site search Concordia Directories Search Student Hub Concordia.ca Students Course registration Academic advising Your undergraduate student lexicon Your undergraduate student lexicon Here s how to wrap your head around university lingo As a new student you might have a hard time navigating all the administrative words and acronyms used by the university. With that in mind here s a list of Concordia specific terms that will come in extra handy as you register for classes and begin your first year. Your need to know Concordia terms Academic year Composed of three terms a Summer term early May to mid August and followed by two regular sessions. A fall term September to December and a winter term January to April . Undergraduate Calendar This official document outlines all undergraduate academic programs offered at Concordia. It is meant to help you understand the university s academic and administrative structure policies and procedures. Although there s an actual calendar inside it this document is way more than just a calendar Faculty A branch of a university encompassing various related academic disciplines e.g. Faculty of Arts Science John Molson School of Business. Department An academic unit within a Faculty dealing with a particular field of knowledge e.g. Department of Biology Bachelor s degree The first degree obtained at a university. In general a bachelor s degree requires between 90 120 credits to be complete. Certificate Concordia offers several undergraduate certificates usually of 30 credits made up of regular undergraduate courses. Certificates are separate from degree programs however courses taken as part of a certificate program are normally applicable to the appropriate undergraduate degree. Credits A course that spans one semester is typically worth three credits while a two semester course is worth six credits. To be considered full time you must register for a minimum of 12 credits and a maximum of 15 credits per semester. Electives As opposed to a required program course an elective course is one chosen by you based on your interests. Often outside your primary area of study electives help you expand your general knowledge. Deficiencies A deficiency is a course you have not completed that is required for admission to your chosen program. Courses identified as deficiencies must be completed as early in your studies as possible. Transfer Credits Transfer credits are courses that are normally applied towards your degree or program of study. This may shorten the length of your time it takes to complete your program degree. You may earn transfer credits from another post secondary educational institution with prior permission or by changing degrees within Concordia. Prerequisites and corequisites a prerequisite is a specific course you need to take before another course. You can find out if a course has a prerequisite by reading the course description directly in the registration system or in the undergraduate calendar. It s best to fit the prerequisite you need into your schedule now so you have access to your desired course in a later semester. A co requisite is when a specific course must be taken in the same academic term as another course unless you ve already successfully completed it. Exemptions you may be granted exemption from a Concordia course based on previous studies. This means that you have already covered the work at another institution and have successfully met its minimum grade requirement. An exemption from a course has no credit value towards a degree which means it will not decrease the number of courses you need to complete your degree but it will rather either let you skip ahead to a more advanced course or it is replaced with a course chosen in consultation with your academic advisor. Course Swap A function in the registration system that allows you to add and drop a course simultaneously. This tool eliminates risk when performing actions such as switching sections of the same course resolving a time conflict in you schedule etc. Course Waitlist A feature in the registration system that allows you to indicate your interest in taking a course that is already full. If a spot becomes available in the course you would automatically be notified and placed in the course. Note not all classes have a waitlist and sometimes the waitlist is reserved for a specific group of students. Class schedule builder A tool in the registration system that allows you to lay out your schedule in a calendar format and generate a personalized course schedule based on your chosen combination of classes. Note the tool does not register you for any courses but will allow you to add courses directly to your enrollment course cart. DNE Did Not Enter The DNE deadline is the date by which you can officially withdraw from a course without having to pay for it. If you drop a course before this deadline it won t appear on either your student record or official transcript. DISC Discontinued If you miss the DNE deadline but still want to drop a course you can as long as it s done before the DISC deadline. While it won t affect your GPA discontinuing a course will result in a DISC notation on your student record and official transcript. You will also be kept financially responsible for the payment of tuition and other fees pertaining to the course. Permanent Code The Quebec Ministry of Education requires all the province s universities to have a permanent code for each registered student on whose behalf the university receives funding. You can find your permanent code on your unofficial transcript accessible via the My CU Account on the Student Hub.

Engineering and Computer Science students must complete the courses identified as deficiencies before registering for classes. DEC Dipl me d tudes coll giales The diploma earned by CEGEP students upon completion of either the two year or three year program. Degree A degree that is earned by students upon completion of a unified program of study. Department A section within a university Faculty dealing with a particular field of knowledge e.g. Department of English. DISC Discontinued If you miss the DNE deadline but still want to drop a course you can as long as it s done before the DISC deadline. While it won t affect your GPA discontinuing a course will result in a DISC notation on your student record and official transcript. You will also be kept financially responsible for the payment of tuition and other fees pertaining to the course. DNE Did Not Enter The DNE deadline is the date by which you can officially withdraw from a course without having to pay for it. If you drop a course before this deadline it won t appear on either your student record or official transcript. Doctorate PhD The highest degree obtained at a university usually requiring three to five years of original research in a specialized field of study. E Exemptions Concordia will grant you an exemption when you successfully complete a specific course and meet any indicated minimum grade for the course. An exemption does not count as credit towards a degree so it will not decrease the number of courses you need to complete your degree it will let you skip ahead to a more advanced course. Courses for which Concordia gives you an exemption may not be taken for credit. If you received an exemption for a course required for your program you must take another course in the same department instead to be determined in consultation with a departmental advisor. Extended credit program ECP Academic qualifications presented by students applying from institutions outside Quebec should be comparable to those expected of students applying from within Quebec. Students who have not successfully completed a two year pre university program may be admitted to the Extended Credit Program which requires them to take a minimum of 30 additional credits. This ensures the time to complete a program at Concordia is the same as it would be at any other university outside Quebec about four years of full time study. The Undergraduate Calendar lists ECP requirements for each Faculty. F Faculty A branch of a university encompassing various related disciplines e.g. Faculty of Arts Science John Molson School of Business. G Grade Point Average GPA Students are required to maintain an acceptable standard of performance. Academic standing is calculated at the end of each academic year summer fall winter terms provided they have attempted a minimum of 12 credits. Graduate student Students registered in a Master s or Doctorate PhD degree graduate certificate or diploma program. H Honours An honours program consists of 60 or more credits in a discipline with superior performance required to enter and remain in the program. Honours are highly concentrated programs that are primarily for those planning to pursue graduate studies. Honours programs often require the completion of an independent final project or thesis. I Independent student Independent students register for individual courses normally on a part time basis. Typical Independent students are interested in taking courses for general knowledge or job related purposes. Others may be interested in specific subject areas or may take courses to test the waters prior to embarking on a part time or full time basis as an undergraduate student at the University. Interdisciplinary An interdisciplinary major is a program consisting of credits comprised of courses from a range of disciplines. Interdisciplinary minor programs usually consist of less credits and are to be combined with a department major specialization or honours. L Letter of intent This letter should express your reasons for choosing a program your short and long range goals and any relevant job or volunteer experience. Limited enrolment program A program in which the number of applications normally does not significantly exceed the number of available places. A minimum admission standard is set and admission is granted on an ongoing basis until all seats are filled. M Major A major is a sequence of courses totalling 36 or more credits except in the John Molson School of Business where the major consists of at least 24 credits in a particular discipline in addition to the required 42 credit core. A major is a more general degree applicable to many different careers and allows for the greatest exploration outside of the chosen program. Master s degree The second degree obtained at a university after the completion of a specialized program in a particular discipline. A bachelor s degree is required for entry into the program. The degree normally requires two years of full time study and research. Mature entry program MEP Canadians and Permanent Residents 21 years of age or older who lack the normal pre university schooling may still be considered for admission to MEP. Entrants must satisfy certain admission requirements. All students admitted to the MEP are required to take a minimum of 18 credits in addition to the regular 90 or 120 credit degree program requirements. Minor A minor is a sequence of courses totalling 24 or more credits that provides a basic introduction to the methodology and key concepts of a discipline or field except in the John Molson School of Business where a minor consists of 12 credits in a chosen discipline in addition to the required 42 credit core . Students are not required to take a minor. Completion of one or more minors does not meet the requirements for a degree but must be done in combination with a major specialization or honours. O Open programs Programs in which the number of qualified candidates does not exceed the number of places available. Normally all qualified applicants are accepted. Option In the Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science concentrations are referred to as programs. Most of these programs have options where students take a number of related courses in a chosen area. P Part time vs. full time If you study full time you will normally take 30 credits a year. If you study part time you may take up to 18 credits during the regular session September April spread equally over the two terms. It is also possible to take up to 12 credits in the summer session although the range of course offerings tends to be limited. Permanent Code The Quebec Ministry of Education requires all Quebec Universities to have a permanent code for each registered student on whose behalf the University receives funding. Q Quebec residency Quebec residents pay a lower tuition rate at Quebec Universities than other Canadian or international students. To pay Quebec resident tuition rates first you must apply for Quebec resident tuition status. If you do not do this you will pay higher tuition rates. Quota program A program in which the number of applications exceeds the number of places available e.g. Communication Studies. Entry therefore is both competitive and selective and closing dates for applications are stringently applied. S Specialization A specialization is a sequence of courses totalling 60 or more credits. The specialization provides in depth study for those interested in a career in their chosen field while still leaving a substantial number of credits to the individual s choice. In a few cases it includes a performance requirement. In addition to courses in a particular discipline the specialization may include courses in other related fields. T Transfer Credit Transfer credits are courses that are normally applied towards your degree and so reduce the length of your program. You may earn transfer credits from another post secondary educational institution or by changing degrees within Concordia. U Undergraduate Student Students registered in a bachelor s degree or certificate program whether on a full time or a part time basis. V Visiting Student A student currently enrolled at another university who has permission from that other university to take specific courses at Concordia.

Here are some essentials. Phase 1After you apply Phase 2Newly admitted Phase 3Before classes begin Phase 4Starting your first term Find key tools and support and start university with confidence 1 Put Concordia online platforms to use Much of the information that you ll need to know about your classes is at your fingertips with these online tools. Student Hub Your Student Hub provides easy access to digital tools personal information services and resources and more. My CU Account is where you will register for courses update your personal information access your academic requirements report view your exam schedules and see your grades after each term.

Useful links Student Hub Moodle Udemy How to view your academic requirements report Concordia Office 365 accounts 2 Waitlists drop deadlines Once the term begins monitor your waitlisted courses and swaps carefully. Make sure you know and understand the DNE and DISC deadlines. Waitlist You may have joined the waitlist for a class. As other students adjust their schedules at the beginning of term you may automatically be enrolled in the waitlisted course. If you had set up the swap function you ll also automatically drop another course. Review the swaps you set up to make sure they still fit with your plans. Withdrawing from a course The DNE deadline which stands for Did Not Enter is the date by which you can officially withdraw from a course without having to pay for it. If you drop a course before this deadline it won t appear on either your student record or official transcript. Discontinuing a course If you want to drop a course after the DNE deadline you can as long as it s before the DISC deadline short for Discontinued . While it won t affect your GPA grade point average discontinuing a course will result in a DISC notation on your student record and official transcript. You will also need to pay the tuition fee for the discontinued course. Deciding to stop attending a course is not the same as dropping a course. If you do not drop a course and simply stop doing the coursework and participating you will receive a failing grade.

Future students Student hub Alumni friends Parents Faculty staff Media Site search Concordia Directories Search Academic Community Conduct Student employeesMandatory Sexual Violence Awareness and Prevention Training Additional information for student employees at Concordia University Concordia University is committed to fostering a safe and respectful learning environment and as a student employee you play an integral role in upholding this commitment. In your role as a student employee you need to be aware of the power you could potentially hold over students how power dynamics can complicate consent and the behaviours that can lead to an unhealthy learning and working environment. Finally you need to know about the Consensual Romantic or Sexual Relationship Guidelines at Concordia University. Power dynamics The mandatory training on sexual violence awareness and prevention also known as It Takes All of Us training provides information about consent and the situations that can complicate consent. If you have not yet completed this training please do so as soon as possible by following the It Takes All of Us Training link in your MyConcordia portal. Power dynamics such as those between students and instructors may create an environment in which consent is complicated due to the power an instructor has over a student s grades athletic opportunities or employment. For example can a coach and an athlete have a relationship if the coach has power over the athlete s career Can a teaching assistant and a student have a relationship if the teaching assistant can influence the student s grades The athlete and student in these examples might feel pressured to do things they do not want to because of these power dynamics. The types of power you hold as a student employee can also be influenced by systemic forms of power held in categories such as race gender ability class age and education. It is important to remember that the impacts of these dynamics are far reaching and exist because of the way many identities are systemically discriminated against and given less validity. You need to be aware of any biases or prejudices that arise in your interactions due to these power dynamics. Learning environment Part of your role as a student employee is to help create a healthy learning and working environment. Creating this healthy environment for students means having ethical relationships that are conscious of power dynamics as well as understanding the behaviours that may result in an unhealthy environment. Here are some examples of behaviours that can result in an unhealthy learning and working environment and that can create an uncomfortable environment for students Seeing students outside of university hours especially off campus Inviting students to personal engagements Offering mentorship to students based on a romantic interest Commenting on students appearance Making sexual comments or jokes Making advances Flirting Guidelines In January 2018 Concordia University released the Consensual Romantic or Sexual Relationship Guidelines. The guidelines strongly discourage all instructors from commencing or continuing any consensual romantic or sexual relationship with a student. The guidelines define Instructor and Student as follows Instructor Any university employee who is teaching advising supervising mentoring overseeing the allocation of resources to and or coaching students. Such employees include but are not limited to full and or part time faculty members faculty administrators librarians laboratory or other instructors principal investigators as well as teaching assistants research assistants staff members and coaches and coaching assistants. Student Any person registered in a course or program on a full or part time basis for credit or not and includes undergraduate and graduate students independent students as well as visiting students exchange students and interns. Important excerpts from the guidelines Whenever an instructor is or in the future might reasonably become responsible for teaching advising allocating resources or supervising a student or more generally is or in the future might reasonably be in a position to exercise authority over a student Romantic or sexual relationships between them should be avoided and If such a relationship is not avoided any existing or past romantic or sexual relationship constitutes an actual or perceived conflict of interest and must be disclosed pursuant to the present guidelines. Student employees can disclose to their direct supervisor. Please consult the guidelines for more information on where and how to disclose a conflict of interest. Thank you for taking the time to review this important information for student employees. We are committed to ensuring you fully understand your responsibilities as a student employee.

You are now encouraged to deepen your knowledge of this subject matter by taking the latest module developed by Concordia s Sexual Assault Resource Centre SARC called Systems of Oppression and Intersectionality. Understanding the roots of sexual violence Though not mandatory for students taking this module is an excellent way to learn about the role of power dynamics as a root of sexual violence. Sexual violence is not about sex and desire it s about power explains Jennifer Drummond manager at SARC. Unequal power dynamics impact how sexual violence is experienced and create barriers for survivors when it comes to reporting misconduct and accessing support. Systems of Oppression and Intersectionality takes 30 minutes to complete and touches on the following subjects Systems of oppression and how they contribute to the root causes of sexual violence The definition of intersectionality and how it relates to power dynamics and sexual violence How to intervene when we see or hear sexual violence around us Methods of support that take into account marginalized or oppressed survivors Building on momentum Since 2019 more than 73 000 faculty staff and students have taken It Takes All of Us. For Lisa White executive director of the Equity Office this speaks to the Concordia community s commitment to this issue. It s heartening to see the community response to mandatory training over the last few years. Staff and faculty who have already taken the base module were asked to take the new one in September and responded in overwhelming numbers she reports. I encourage all students to take the time to learn more about the roots of oppression and intersectionality. Take the Systems of Oppression and Intersectionality training module now.

The task force began its work in March 2018 with weekly meetings that focused on reviewing relevant university policies and procedures relevant legislation and presentations from key members and units of the university community. Through these meetings and presentations along with a survey community conversations and open calls for feedback from stakeholders the task force was able to identify common themes and establish priorities. The recommendations in this report fall into the following five key areas 1. Policies and Procedures 2. Training and Education 3. Support and Services 4. Communications 5. Standing Committee on Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Violence Given the university s commitment to addressing sexual misconduct and sexual violence it is important for us to be self reflective and open to change. The task force recommendations serve as stepping stones to a larger cultural shift that is required to ensure that the community knows how to support victim survivors that those affected have the tools they need to make informed decisions and above all to bring about the safest and most flourishing environment possible for the whole Concordia community. The task force would like to thank all individuals and groups who contributed to this important process.

The notion of inclusive excellence asks us to consider the ways in which diverse experiences contribute to an enriched academic environment in ways that may not be captured by the traditional measures we default to in conversations about merit excellence and accomplishment. The consideration of inclusive excellence should act as a starting point for taking into account the role of EDI principles in our processes and systems. This page outlines best practices and guidelines and offers resources for the equitable and inclusive recruitment of tenure track faculty members at Concordia University. It will be updated periodically to reflect the university s expanding commitment to diversity in the professoriate. As always the Office of the Provost and Vice President Academic is always available to consult on any aspect of the recruitment process. Best practices From Department Hiring Committee DHC composition to posting the job ad In general the best practices discussed on this website address the principles of including diverse perspectives in the decision making process broadening the applicant pool giving candidates of all backgrounds a fair opportunity to make their best case for the position in question and reducing the potential impact of unconscious bias. a. DHC composition As a first step departments and faculties are advised to first consider the formation of their respective Department Hiring Committees DHCs . Departments and faculties should seek to include colleagues on the DHCs who are themselves members of groups that are underrepresented in the relevant discipline s and within Concordia s professoriate. Achieving equity and diversity in the composition of DHCs includes where possible Ensuring gender parity in DHC membership Ensuring representation of underrepresented groups Being aware of the service burden of probationary members especially those from underrepresented groups and Relieving the representational burden of DHC members from underrepresented groups by ensuring that all DHC members espouse a commitment to inclusive excellence and to the institution s equity diversity and inclusion goals. Once constituted please email the list of DHC members to equity.vpfdi concordia.ca. Finally each DHC member will be contacted to complete the required and recommended EDI training. In addition it is highly recommended that DHC members also complete the Tri Council s unconscious bias training module English Fran ais and the Harvard Implicit Association Test prior to the first DHC meeting. b. EDI workshops for DHCs Participation in training on the importance of equity diversity and inclusion and on the potential negative impact of unconscious bias on the career paths of individuals from underrepresented groups is an important part of our strong commitment to recruit diverse faculty and conduct an equitable and inclusive hiring process. While not sufficient in and of themselves the workshops play a vital role as part of larger plans to embed inclusive excellence throughout Concordia and are a direct way in which participants can contribute to these plans. Participation in mandatory training on the importance of equity diversity and inclusion and on the potential negative impact of unconscious bias on the career paths of individuals from underrepresented groups before starting the hiring process is required of all Department Hiring Committees involved in the search process. For questions and to RSVP for a session please email equity.vpfdi concordia.ca. c. Equity Advocate option An EDI Advocate is an individual who may accompany a search process for a particular faculty position in order to facilitate the full consideration of equity matters by the DHC throughout the search timeline. In general they would assist the DHC in ensuring that equitable and inclusive practices are used in all aspects of the recruitment process. For additional information or with any questions please contact Dr. Mark Andrew Galang Villacorta Senior Equity Advisor Equity Office. Some specific ways that the EDI Advocate can contribute to the process include Make recommendations on DHC composition taking into account both representation and commitments to inclusive excellence Review job ads for inclusive language and content Support the DHC in identifying possible outlets and networks within which to circulate job postings Help with the design of standard evaluation forms that include the criteria developed by the DHC Advise the DHC on how to include contributions to diversity as part of the evaluation criteria for all applicants and on how to evaluate the responses received Gather and disseminate resources such as research reports and summaries and sample evaluation rubrics and interview questions Engage in discussions with the DHC on research on multiple facets of the search process such as unconscious bias in evaluation the role of applicant pool diversity and the gendered dynamics of recommendation letters and their potential impact Review the data on the diversity of the applicant pool for the position and the disciplinary area s availability pool and if required make suggestions on proactive measures to enhance the diversity of the applicant pool Support the DHC in establishing long lists and short lists that consider diverse representation and commitment to inclusive excellence Advise on the creation of and or review drafts of reasoned reports prior to submission to the Department Personnel Committee DPC Some considerations for the EDI Advocate s participation include The DHC sets the parameters for the EDI Advocate s participation The EDI Advocate solely advises on EDI matters The EDI Advocate may on occasion consult with additional Office of the Provost staff on questions which cannot be answered immediately or that require additional information and authority In general it may be optimal for the EDI Advocate to not participate directly during interviews and solely advise on the process Final decisions on all matters related to hiring are solely the purview of the DHC d. Setting the criteria This section outlines the major considerations with respect to EDI when developing the selection criteria. Some general examples are included for additional examples from Concordia see Examples of hiring criteria under the Resources section below. For examples of evaluation templates from different institutions see Examples of evaluation templates under Resources. Upon selecting the hiring committee members schedule a first meeting in order to develop the evaluation criteria and write the job posting The meeting should take place well in advance of the application deadline in order to allow sufficient time to develop the criteria and post the position. Discuss the meaning of excellence in the context of the position in question Have an open discussion on the required qualifications of the position addressing not only the needs of the committee members and specific department but of Concordia as a whole. All members of the hiring committee should articulate their views and understanding of the criteria. Resist the urge to come up with a set of vocabulary without ensuring that all members are in agreement about the meaning thereof. Does everyone mean the same thing by words like productive collegial distinguished versatile It is important to be very specific. Develop inclusive evaluation criteria via consensus through consideration of the full range of needs of the department and university community as a whole In developing criteria for the position go beyond the major categories of research teaching and service and define what about these categories is most important for the position. In addition discuss instances when it is necessary to go beyond conventional metrics of excellence and to consider experiences of engaging diversity as contributing to the goals of the academic environment. In the end discussing and deciding upon selection criteria by consensus supports the effectiveness integrity and equity of the search process. It decreases the probability that applicants will be favoured due to reasons unrelated to the departmental and institutional needs such as vague notions of fit. An Example of inclusive evaluation criteria is as follows taken from the University of Michigan Handbook for Faculty Searches and Hiring Potential for evidence of scholarly impact Potential for evidence of research productivity Potential for evidence of research funding Potential for evidence of collaboration Fit with department s priorities Ability to make positive contribution to department s climate Potential demonstrated ability to attract and supervise diverse graduate students Potential demonstrated ability to teach and supervise diverse undergraduates Potential demonstrated ability to be a conscientious university community member Have an equity advisor advocate review the job posting including the established criteria prior to publication and circulation It is recommended that the selected EDI Advocate review and approve the job posting prior to posting. Non traditional and unconventional research Academic and professional excellence remain the principle criteria for recruitment. However the meaning of excellence should not be restricted to overly narrow or traditional metrics. As such committees should take steps to ensure that the evaluation process places sufficient value on and gives consideration to non traditional or unconventional research and scholarship including those based on Indigenous ways of knowing focused on underrepresented populations or outside of conventional disciplinary boundaries. e. Crafting the job ad The goal of the job ad is to appeal to the broadest possible range of potential applicants thereby building a broad deep diverse applicant pool. As such not all sections will be pertinent to every applicant. However certain sections may impact the decision of applicants to apply. With sections that are clearly delineated different applicants should be able to identify the information that is most pertinent to them. The following are some general recommendations for crafting the job ad. Note that when authorization is given to post a faculty position the department and Faculty will work with the Office of the Provost to ensure that the advertisement includes all required information within the Concordia approved template. Keep language as broad as possible while meeting specific department needs First and foremost departmental need should be assessed and the required skills should be listed in the job ad Simultaneously the use of overly narrow language in defining the disciplinary area such as focusing on a single research area or the use of particular methods when not essential to the position discourages qualified candidates from applying The specificity of language in the ad should not be confused with the specificity of the evaluation criteria while the evaluation criteria should be precise the position description should be drafted broadly Include potentially related subdisciplines When relevant indicate interest in non traditional interdisciplinary and emerging fields which tend to attract more female and other underrepresented minority candidates In instances where a specific departmental need must be filled in a narrowly defined area continue to communicate that the recruitment of underrepresented groups is a priority throughout the job ad Request evidence of candidates past efforts and future plans for engaging diversity. Describe the institution including location Emphasize opportunities for collaboration within Concordia and the greater Montreal region Emphasize Concordia s commitment to cultivating a diverse academic community Describe the department including commitments to building a diverse faculty complement Include commitment to building diverse faculty that values equity and encourages underrepresented candidates to apply Clarify why your department in particular seeks diverse talent Examples from the Academic Affairs Forum a.k.a. EAB The History Department has demonstrated success in developing a diverse faculty and we are especially interested in candidates from underrepresented groups as well as individuals who have experience in working with diverse student populations. Beyond meeting fully its legal obligations for nondiscrimination the College is committed to building a diverse and inclusive community where members from all backgrounds can live learn and thrive together. As a campus with a continually growing diverse student body we encourage applications from women minorities and individuals with a commitment to mentoring underrepresented demographics in the sciences. Include Concordia University official Territorial Acknowledgement Employment Equity Statement and immigration status declaration. When posting in outlets external to Concordia include the above elements in the stated order. Job ads posted on the Concordia Jobs website will automatically include these elements. Invite candidates to disclose career interruptions or personal circumstances that may have had an impact on productivity Examples of career interruptions include but are not limited to maternity or parental leave extended sick leave and barriers related to a disabled condition. f. Posting and circulating the job ad Recruitment is an active process and we must build our applicant pools as opposed to only posting job ads and hoping that excellent diverse applicants apply. Having a diverse applicant pool is perhaps the most important stage in an equitable search as it allows the possibility of considering diverse candidates for faculty positions. Further ensuring that as many qualified applicants as possible are considered protects the integrity of the search process. Beyond the requirements of the CUFA collective agreement regarding posting of job ads CUFA CA Article 12.02 f the main recommendation is to circulate the job as broadly as possible within our and our colleagues networks on outlets targeting diverse populations on social media in addition to print and online journals. Note that this is the responsibility of the entire committee and department not only that of faculty from underrepresented groups. Departments are encouraged to identify outlets specific to their discipline and over time build a list of outlets that can be accessed for targeted outreach. This information can be obtained through professional associations conferences invited talks personal contacts and other activities. Building relationships with colleagues and institutions is crucial. This increases visibility of the department and Concordia within diverse networks. It may enable the DHC to focus on particular areas of underrepresentation by soliciting the aide of well connected knowledgeable and influential colleagues. Finally active recruitment enables the DHC to reach those who otherwise may not have been given an opportunity to consider applying to Concordia such as those who are not engaging in an active job search and those who are outside the conventional academy. The concept of upstream recruitment signifies that we are constantly building our networks to include diverse scholars administrators and community members who can help us draw attention to positions that become available in the future. The main recommendations using this strategy include tracking prospects from conferences and disciplinary events including collecting and storing information on promising candidates and seeking out professional opportunities that are frequented by diverse candidates each faculty member developing their own long term recruiting relationships with diverse graduate programs and periodically visiting those departments and bringing value to the relationship in return tasking specific department members to use open access resources such as journals publications and discipline related websites to identify potential candidates engaging with advanced graduate students in professional development and meaningful on campus interactions with faculty. In order to set diversity targets for the applicant pool as a whole it is helpful to have an idea of the representation of different designated groups in your field and department. The following are a few examples of resources which may be used as benchmarks for discussion of representation in departments and disciplines. The first five focus on the Canadian Academy. The final three focus on U.S. academy which may have parallels with Canadian higher education with the final two focusing on specific disciplines. Departments are encouraged to identify similar resources in their disciplines when available. CAUT Report April 2018 Underrepresented and Underpaid diversity and equity among Canada s post secondary education teachers Henry F. Dua E. James C. E. Kobayashi A. Li P. Ramos H. Smith M. S. 2017 . The Equity Myth Racialization and Indigeneity at Canadian Universities Engineers Canada Canadian Engineers for Tomorrow Female students Engineers Canada 2018 National Membership Information Canadian Association of Professional Academic Librarians Census 2018 Survey of earned doctorates American Institute of Physics Statistical Research Center American Psychological Association Center for Workforce Studies Finally when circulating postings it is essential to keep language very neutral and to focus on scholarship. Candidates should not be given any inclination that they have any advantage by applying simply because they have been contacted. Similarly no mention of the candidate s self identification should be made when inviting them to consider applying for positions as the primary criteria by which all applicants want to be judged by is their research excellence and professional experience. The following is sample language that may be modified when contacting potential applicants and or requesting assistance in circulating the job ad Dear name of recipient We are currently hiring for a tenure track faculty position in Equity Studies and I thought you would be interested in seeing the attached position. Would you kindly take note of this opportunity and share it with your network Thank you name of sender Best practices From the applicant survey to drafting the Department Hiring Committee DHC reports a. Applicant survey and self identification To support departmental efforts to diversify their applicant pools the Office of the Provost will continue to survey all applicants to tenure track positions by sending them an email inviting them to complete a survey in which they may indicate their membership in federally and provincially designated groups as well as their sexual orientation and gender identity minority membership. The results of this survey will be confidentially compiled into aggregate anonymous data that will be made available to the DHCs at various points of the search timeline to assess the diversity in the pool of applicants and long short lists. In order to ensure that applicants are contacted in a timely manner and to enable DHCs to consider the results of the data departments should provide a list of applicants to all relevant postings on a weekly basis throughout the application period as well as a final applicant list at closing to equity.vpfdi concordia.ca. Participation in the applicant survey is voluntary and no identifiable data derived from any single survey participant shall be provided to the hiring committees. Hence the applicant survey is not a means by which applicants may self identify as a member of one or more designated groups to the search committee. As noted in the Employment Equity statement applicants who wish to self identify to the hiring committee may do so in their cover letter or by writing directly to the contact person indicated in the posting. b. Proper record keeping and documentation Departments involved in hiring must document their recruitment processes in a clear and systematic fashion. Keep clear and consistent records throughout the recruitment process such that we can demonstrate that our recruitment processes were transparent open and fair. Please note the following examples of documentation that may be recorded membership details of the recruitment and nomination committee a description of the equity diversity and inclusion training provided to individuals who participated in the process including training on unconscious bias a description of the role of the equity and diversity officer or designated equity diversity and inclusion champion a description of the strategy and proactive efforts made to identify a diverse pool of potential applicants a description of the measures used to ensure that individuals who required accommodation or who experienced career interruptions were not disadvantaged during the nomination process evaluation criteria and assessment grids copies of relevant internal policies and guidelines e.g. equity policies tenure track hiring practices policies collective agreement or equivalent and a description of the best practices used to collect data on the participation of individuals from the four designated groups. This information may be of particular value when drafting the DHCs reports. Finally the work product of hiring committees is accessible by third parties upon submission of an access to information request after vetting by legal prior to release. c. On site interview protocol Just like the entire process itself the on site interview should be semi structured. That is it should contain standardized elements that place a container around discretion but should be flexible enough to allow authentic and engaging scholarly discussion. As a reminder candidates are continuously evaluating us as well. During on campus visits we are hosting candidates in addition to interviewing them and they will likely remain colleagues in our discipline regardless of whether they join us or not. It is our responsibility to be courteous respectful helpful and kind to them and to be positive about Concordia. Doing so upholds our reputation for inclusive excellence and moves us towards our vision of becoming the Next Generation University. Develop a core set of questions All candidates should be asked the same core set of questions by the DHC. Questions should be based on the full range of evaluation criteria required for the position and developed in advance by the hiring committee. Include questions regarding inclusive excellence especially if they are a part of your criteria. Follow up questions based on each candidate s responses are permitted and encouraged after the core set of questions are asked. For examples of interview questions concerning inclusive excellence see Examples of interview questions under the Resources section. In addition to developing core questions determine standards for engaging each candidate including amount of time permitted per question who will keep track of time how they will indicate that time is up whether candidates may go beyond their allotted time and whether interruptions will be permitted. Departments should focus the interview on the professional qualifications of each candidate. For specific questions about the details of the hire including but not limited to salary housing schooling for children and other family members and spousal appointment policies and possibilities candidates should be encouraged to bring forward such inquiries during their meeting with the Dean. If there is something specific you want shared with each candidate make sure the Dean s Office has the information. Develop an agenda for the interview The schedules should be similar in format and have as many identical components as possible including transportation to and from campus where the candidates stay with whom candidates will meet an accessible location for each meeting and regular breaks. Certain candidates may require breaks in their schedules as an accommodation so ideally these would be scheduled for all candidates as a matter of course. Internal candidates should receive the same treatment as external candidates with the additional recommendation that internal candidates be invited for on site interviews and job talks first so that they are not advantaged by their ability to observe the other candidates An exception to having candidate schedules be identical is when candidates request to meet particular members of the campus community. Personalizing the visit for a candidate in this way communicates responsiveness to their needs and a recognition that all members of the Concordia community should feel like they have a place here. Provide a list of people with whom candidates will be meeting in advance. Members of the DHC may only meet with candidates when all DHC members are present. All contact with candidates is considered part of the interview process so it is essential that each DHC member receive the same information from the candidate. Decide on the purpose of meals in advance. If they are designated meetings in which candidates are being evaluated all members of the DHC should be included. If the purpose is to share information with the candidate about the department campus and Montreal then a larger group including graduate students administrators and faculty members from outside the department may attend. If the candidate must engage questions throughout build in time for them to eat at the beginning or end of the meal and by engaging others present at the meal. Ensure that there are opportunities for candidates to seek out information about your campus and community. This can take the form of printed information online resources shared in advance and particular meetings which are geared towards providing information on campus and Montreal and are not deemed as part of the interview process such as meals. Finally do not leave candidates alone with faculty members who are known to be hostile to interviewees or not be supportive of inclusive excellence. Ensure there is a process in place to deal with the expression of hostile or discriminatory comments should they arise and that all involved in the search including the candidates are aware of it. Prepare the candidate for the interview. Identify a clear point of contact for the logistics of the visit including air travel ground transportation lodging dietary restrictions reimbursements any documentation and accommodations. Be clear on the procedure for reimbursements and other transactions expenses that will and will not be covered and maintain contact throughout the search process. Reimbursements should be processed as soon as possible. Develop and share the agenda for the interview with each candidate well in advance of their interview see 2 above . Candidates who require accommodations throughout any stage of the recruitment process may also contact Dr. Nadia Hardy Interim Deputy Provost and Vice Provost Faculty Development and Inclusion. See 5 below for sample email language regarding inquiring about accommodations. In addition departments who have questions on accommodations during the interview process are encouraged to contact Dr. Hardy in advance. Prepare the department for the interview Ensure that the details dates times locations of each candidate s visit is communicated with sufficient notice to the entire department and any additional units of interest. This increases the chances that colleagues will be able to consider participating in the process in some way. Similarly ensure that each candidate s materials are available for review and encourage colleagues to read them. In addition provide access to the job posting the criteria on which they are being evaluated and the form to be used to evaluate each candidate see Examples of evaluation templates under the Resources section . Remind department members that they are evaluating each candidate s scholarly record potential and skills and not to tokenize any of the candidates by emphasizing their demographic characteristics. Though diversification is one of many considerations in the process it is counterproductive to point out the need for the department to hire women or people with disabilities for example. Please refer to the Guide to Screening and Selection in Employment by the Canadian Human Rights Commission which includes questions to avoid asking during job interviews. If candidates volunteer information or ask questions about topics that interviewers are not permitted to ask themselves such as childcare you may provide a helpful resource if you have one and then encourage them to bring this up in the meeting with the Dean. Importantly ensure that the inquiry and their response does not enter into deliberations about their qualifications. Ensure that all candidates meet a diverse group of people It is important that department members outside of the DHC meet the candidates and attend the job talks. In addition diverse candidates occasionally desire to meet with members of their community in order to explore possibilities for community should they end up working here. Inquire via email whether each candidate would like to meet with particular groups of people during their visit. You may use or modify language contained in the sample email amended from the in person EDI workshop Dear We look forward to welcoming you to Concordia University on January 1 2022. Please find a tentative schedule of your visit attached hereto. In order to make it most beneficial we would be pleased to facilitate opportunities for you to exchange with colleagues whom you would be particularly interested to meet from either within or outside our department. Thank you for sending me a list of names at your earliest convenience. I also invite you to inform me of any special needs we can accommodate in order to make your visit more enjoyable as well as any dietary restrictions you may have. If you anticipate requiring accommodations throughout any stage of the recruitment process you may contact in confidence Dr. Nadia Hardy Interim Deputy Provost and Vice Provost Faculty Development and Inclusion at vpfdi concordia.ca or by phone at 514 848 2424 extension 4323. Thank you Provide standardized opportunities for providing departmental feedback and clearly communicate the process and expectations Develop a standard form on which department members may provide feedback on each candidate. See the standardized form example in Examples of evaluation templates under the Resources section. There are no policies preventing the gathering of anonymous feedback. However note that accountability and visibility can hedge against discrimination so anonymous comments should be weighed accordingly. Consider asking reviewers to indicate how much exposure they had to each candidate these should be taken into consideration in weighing their input particularly in the case of anonymous feedback. Finally clearly communicate how feedback will be gathered and the type of feedback that should be provided i.e. feedback on specific facets of the candidate s qualifications and not generic feedback about preferences in order to be most helpful to the committee. Evaluate final candidates Evaluations must be based on evidence provided by the candidate in reference to the required criteria for the position. Bias may enter at any stage of the process. At all stages including the final stages of evaluating short listed candidates advice on minimizing bias and the guidelines for evaluating candidates should be reviewed. The committee should meet immediately after each candidate s visit. This protects against bias and maximizes recall of each candidate s actual performance. Focus on the strengths and concerns of each candidate. DHC members should view each on campus interviewee equally and not rank or compare them until all visits have been completed and each candidate has been discussed in a post interview meeting. Whereas committee members may have had their preferences prior to the short list once candidates make it to this final stage they should be given an equal opportunity to make their case for joining the department. Going into interviews viewing candidates as my favourite or least favourite increases the chances of confirmation bias and precludes us from learning new information about candidates that is important in consideration of their suitability for the position. Ensure that the information used to evaluate each candidate is relevant to the range of criteria developed. Only information provided to the entire DHC should be considered in deliberations. Do not consider personal circumstances or characteristics in your evaluations. These include but are not limited to whether candidates have partners or children need accommodations have been to Canada are too young or too old speak with an accent will attend informal non required social events outside of business hours have ever seen snow or will get along with particular faculty members. Relatedly exercise caution in regards to strong emotional reactions whether positive or negative to candidates. Many factors may influence our partiality or disapproval toward candidates on an emotional level such as culture shared life experiences in group favouritism stereotypes and bias. When strong emotions are present it is important that we reflect and examine the reasons for them as opposed to acting on them prematurely. d. Drafting the DHC reports The goal of the reasoned reports from an EDI perspective is to highlight the procedural fairness of the search process. In other words the result of the recruitment initiative should not necessarily be the emphasis but rather the extent to which the process itself was equitable. To aid in drafting reasoned reports that allow the reader to access the procedural fairness of the hiring in question we list guiding questions and principles below to inform the preparation of those elements required by the collective agreement.

Specifically Focus on comparing the nominee with the specific requirements of position Avoid using stereotypical adjectives when describing character and skills especially when providing a letter for a woman e.g. avoid words like nice kind agreeable sympathetic compassionate selfless giving caring warm nurturing maternal etc. Consider using stand out adjectives for both men and women where appropriate e.g. superb excellent outstanding confident successful ambitious knowledgeable intellectual etc. and Use the nominee s formal title and surname instead of their first name. NOTES REGARDING THE HIRING PROCESS The hiring process is governed by the CUFA Collective Agreement the Policy on Research Chairs VPRGS 7 and accompanying guidelines. As such The DHC is responsible for reviewing applications and recommending the appointment to an academic position to the Dean The DHC must forward a recommendation and reasoned report regarding the academic appointment and a recommendation and reasoned report regarding the position to the Department Personnel Committee DPC and the Dean together with the hiring dossier of the recommended candidate s The DPC shall forward its reasoned recommendation to the Dean and Any conflict of interest or perceived conflict of interest between an applicant and a member of the DHC or DPC or between members of these committees must be disclosed immediately. The Chair of the DHC or DPC when not in conflict or perceived conflict of interest in collaboration with the Dean s and the Provost s offices will discuss and implement appropriate accommodations to remove the conflict. Relevant articles of the CUFA CA 12.01 12.02 12.03 12.08g to k . Unconscious bias Overview Our brains are continuously processing enormous amounts of stimuli necessitating the action of sorting and grouping much of which is done effortlessly and without conscious direction. Schemas are templates that sort examples into broad categories based on experience are activated automatically outside of conscious awareness beyond our control and are therefore referred to as implicit or unconscious. There schemas are essential to daily functioning and are not in and of themselves negative. However the application of schemas to people including the sorting of individuals into social categories such as gender race and ability status may lead to behavior which conflicts with our intention to judge individuals on their own merits. Social categories are accompanied by a host of associations based on experience including experience with stereotypes and general evaluative reactions. These associations are considered biases as they are not neutral and can be either favourable or unfavourable. Unconscious biases are those stereotypes and attitudes that we do not have direct conscious access to are based on broad messages that are ever present in society that cannot be filtered out from our sensory processes and may influence our interactions with and evaluations of people from different social groups. Key characteristics The following are a few key characteristics of unconscious biases according to the Kirwan Institute Implicit biases are pervasive. Everyone possesses them even people with avowed commitments to impartiality such as judges. Implicit and explicit biases are related but distinct mental constructs. They are not mutually exclusive and may even reinforce each other. The implicit associations we hold do not necessarily align with our declared beliefs or even reflect stances we would explicitly endorse. We generally tend to hold implicit biases that favour our own in group though research has shown that we can still hold implicit biases against our in group sometimes referred to in literature as implicit anti in group bias Importance of both diverse representation and commitment of all members of an institution to inclusive excellence Some key papers on implicit anti in group bias Ashburn Nardo L. Knowles M. L. Monteith M. J. 2003 . Black Americans Implicit Racial Associations and their Implications for Intergroup Judgment. Nosek B. A. Banaji M. R. Greenwald A. G. 2002 . Harvesting Implicit Group Attitudes and Beliefs From a Demonstration Web Site. March D. S. Graham R. 2014 . Exploring implicit ingroup and outgroup bias toward Hispanics. Implicit biases are malleable. Our brains are incredibly complex and the implicit associations that we have formed can be gradually unlearned through a variety of debiasing techniques. Recruitment With respect to recruitment considering diversity in our processes gives us an opportunity to challenge the potential role of unconscious bias in those processes. When doing so it is important to consider both diverse representation and commitment of all members of an institution to inclusive excellence. Of course unconscious bias is not the only barrier to an equitable search process. Other challenges include structural barriers to access all along the educational and career pipeline restricted and conventional definitions of merit and rigid adherence to traditional modes of operating. By thoughtfully applying evidence based best practices we make efforts to counter unconscious bias and the systemic barriers which maintain hiring inequities. Common biases The following is are a list of biases that may influence the recruitment process derived from the University of Lethbridge Best Practices for Hiring with a focus on Diversity Equity and other sources which the best practices cited throughout this website are intended to address. Halo effect the tendency to allow one positive or negative quality to dominate judgment of all other qualities. First impressions drawing immediate conclusions that overlook and ignore any additional relevant information leading to a snap judgment. Cloning favour those who think look or act as you do. Stereotyping grouping people together based on oversimplified categories. Assumptions taking for granted the attribution of characteristics and behaviors without evidence. Ethnocentrism belief that your own culture and ethnic group provides the only right way and all others are inferior. Confirmation bias favouring information that confirms your previously existing beliefs or biases. Reactive devaluation devaluing a proposal if it appears to originate from an antagonist. Mere exposure effect or familiarity principle tendency prefer things merely due to familiarity. Strategies to mitigate bias There are particular circumstances that can increase the chances of unconscious bias exacting an effect on our decision making times of high stress time pressure feeling tired being engaged in multiple tasks having a lack of critical mass in terms of representation and ambiguity and or lack of information. All of these circumstances can become part of the recruitment process therefore they are addressed in the following recommended strategies to mitigate bias. Minimize distraction and allow sufficient time for applicant evaluations The first and most basic strategy is to minimize distractions. When our attention is divided between multiple tasks unconscious bias may serve as one of the shortcuts used to help us accomplish those different tasks. Similarly scheduling sufficient time to review will minimize the risks of similar shortcuts being used. Familiar strategies such as reviewing dossiers in a quiet place where one is unlikely to be disturbed turning off electronic notifications scheduling blocks of time for the review process and taking one s time to go through each assigned dossier thoroughly will go a long way in supporting the integrity of the search process. Minimize discretion Unmitigated discretion present in the process leaves us susceptible to the influence of unconscious bias. Hence a semi structured process is recommended i.e. one that simultaneously has standardized elements embedded throughout but at the same time is flexible enough to allow for open discussion and free exchange of scholarly ideas. Details on such practices such as standardized evaluation criteria and forms questions and schedules are found in the Best practices sections above. Counter stereotype imaging Exposure to images of highly successful competent and well regarded people from diverse backgrounds has been shown to reduce the influence of unconscious bias. This can be done in variety of ways such as ensuring that there are photographs of diverse scholars throughout the department showcasing the accomplishments of diverse scholars on websites and newsletters having diverse representation on committees and simply by taking the time to think about examples in one s institution or field. Conversely note that the absence of images of accomplished people of diverse backgrounds may reinforce bias. Inclusion strategies Using inclusion strategies i.e. keeping qualified applicants in the pool as opposed to exclusion strategies i.e. removing unqualified applicants from the pool has been demonstrated to not only be more accurate but to also reduce the potential influence of bias in evaluation. This is due to the application of more stringent standards when applying inclusion strategies which also focuses attention on the qualifications of each individual as opposed to stereotypical group characteristics.
